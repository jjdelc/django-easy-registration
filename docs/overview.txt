Django easy registration
========================

The goal of Django easy registration is to make user registration as 
easy as possible to new users without having to ask them for unnecessary
information during the sign up process.

On your site you should have a topbar or some message with something like:
    
    "Hey, I just need your email to know who you are [____________] [Go]"

That form should aim to the registration endpoint, {% url easyreg_register %}.

If the user exists, will redirect her to the regular login form to enter his or 
her password. (The app comes with an EmailLogin backend that you should plug
in your settings file)

If there is no user with that email on the system, it will automatically
create a new user account with dummy values to fill the User model, and a 
random password. Will send an email to the user with the new password and log
the user in so he can start using the page right after hitting enter!

Set up
======

Plug the easyreg urlconf on your urls.py file udner somwhere reasonable.

    url(r'^accounts/', include('easyreg.urls')),

Note that this works *very* similar to Django-registration

Next you'll need to plug the email auth backend on your settings file

    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
        'easyreg.backends.EmailBackend',
        'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
    )

And you're good to go.

You might want to personalize your own login, logout, profile templates accordingly to your site.
